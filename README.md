## 🔍 What is Nuvai?

Nuvai is a security tool designed to scan source code for common and critical vulnerabilities. It is optimized for detecting issues that often appear in AI-generated, no-code, or low-code platforms — but it's powerful enough to analyze any modern codebase.

> Whether you're building with Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, React, HTML, or C++ — Nuvai has your back.

## 🧪 Example Output (TXT Format)

```txt
[CRITICAL] Dynamic Code Execution
- Description: This code uses 'eval' or 'exec', which can be very dangerous.
- Recommendation: Avoid using eval/exec. Use safer alternatives.

[HIGH] Hardcoded Secret
- Description: A secret or token appears to be hardcoded in the code.
- Recommendation: Store sensitive values in environment variables.
```

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- For PDF export: `fpdf` or `fpdf2` (optional)

```bash
pip install fpdf  # Only if you want PDF reports
```
