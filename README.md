# Nuvai

A professional-grade CLI tool for analyzing and reporting security vulnerabilities in Python codebases, especially those generated by AI or No-Code platforms.

Developed and maintained by [Loai Deeb](https://www.linkedin.com/in/loai-deeb/)

> **Nuvai is where AI meets precision.**  
> A refined scanner built to secure the future of AI-generated code.

## ✨ Overview
AI-generated and no-code tools are accelerating development, but often lack secure defaults. Nuvai helps bridge the gap by analyzing source code for common security flaws — with a focus on simplicity, clarity, and exportable results.

## 🔧 Project Maintenance Tools

To automatically update the `__init__.py` file inside `src/nuvai/` whenever you add or remove modules, run:

```bash
python3 update_init.py
```

This script will regenerate the imports and `__all__` exports so that all modules inside `nuvai` are properly exposed and ready for use.

## 🛠 Installation
### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tinkerlev/nuvai.git
cd nuvai
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note:** PDF export requires `fpdf`. If it's not installed, the tool will skip PDF output without crashing.

---

## 🚀 Usage
### Scan a Python file:
```bash
python3 run.py examples/vulnerable_app.py
```

### After scanning:
- A summary of findings will be shown in the terminal
- You'll be prompted to choose an export format: `json`, `txt`, `html`, or `pdf`
- The report will be saved inside `~/security_reports/` with a timestamped filename
