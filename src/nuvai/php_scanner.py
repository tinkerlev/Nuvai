Description:
This module will be responsible for scanning PHP source code for common
web-related vulnerabilities such as:
- SQL Injection via user input
- XSS in echo statements
- Insecure configuration flags (e.g. display_errors)
- Unsafe file includes or remote execution

This is a placeholder to support future multi-language functionality in Nuvai.
