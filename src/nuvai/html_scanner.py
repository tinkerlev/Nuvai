Description:
This module will handle the scanning of HTML files for security vulnerabilities
such as embedded JavaScript, unescaped user content, inline event handlers,
and common XSS injection patterns.

This placeholder exists to support the future extension of Nuvai
into multi-language code scanning.

Currently not implemented.
