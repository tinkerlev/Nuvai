File: scanner.py

Description:
This file serves as the central dispatcher for the Nuvai scanner.
Its job is to detect what programming language the input code file is written in,
and then delegate the scanning task to the appropriate scanner module (one per language).

This makes the system flexible and easy to extend â€” for example, today we support Python,
but tomorrow we can add scanners for JavaScript, HTML, C++, TypeScript, JSX, PHP and more.

Currently supported:
- Python (.py)

Planned:
- JavaScript (.js)
- TypeScript (.ts, .tsx)
- React JSX (.jsx)
- HTML (.html)
- C++ (.cpp, .cc)
- PHP (.php)
