Description:
This module is intended to support scanning of C++ source code
for common security flaws such as buffer overflows, unsafe memory access,
use of dangerous functions (e.g., gets, strcpy), and more.

It currently serves as a placeholder and will be expanded in future releases
of Nuvai as part of its multi-language security capabilities.
