File: typescript_scanner.py

Description:
This module is intended for scanning TypeScript (.ts, .tsx) code
for common security vulnerabilities. Planned checks may include:
- Unsanitized use of user input in DOM manipulation
- Dangerous usage of eval, innerHTML, setTimeout, etc.
- Insecure HTTP usage

This file currently serves as a placeholder and will be implemented
in future versions of Nuvai.
