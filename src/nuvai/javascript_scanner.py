Description:
This module will eventually handle the scanning of JavaScript source code
for security vulnerabilities such as unsafe use of eval, document.write,
DOM-based XSS, insecure event handlers, and more.

Currently, this module serves as a placeholder for future implementation
and is not yet functional.

To be integrated with scanner.py as part of Nuvai's multi-language support.
