Description:
This module will handle scanning of React JSX files (.jsx) for
vulnerabilities specific to modern frontend frameworks, such as:
- Inline JavaScript injection
- Dangerous props like `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
- Unescaped dynamic values in components

This scanner is not yet implemented but is defined here to support
multi-language capabilities in Nuvai.
