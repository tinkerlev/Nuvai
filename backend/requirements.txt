# requirements.txt

"""
This file lists the Python dependencies required to run the Nuvai backend.
It allows users to set up the project quickly and consistently across different systems (Linux, Windows, macOS).

🛠️ How to install:
Run the following command from the project root (with your virtual environment activated):

    pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

📦 What's included:
- flask: The lightweight web framework powering Nuvai's backend API (used to receive uploaded code files and return scan results).
- flask-cors: Enables secure communication between the React frontend and Flask backend (prevents CORS-related issues).

🛡️ Security:
- Uses pinned versions to ensure compatibility and reduce risk of introducing vulnerabilities via updates.
- Compatible with secure development practices (ISO/IEC 27001 alignment).
- Supports export features: HTML, TXT, PDF (requires additional optional tools like `fpdf`, handled separately).
